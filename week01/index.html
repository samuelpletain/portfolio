    <h1>Week 1 - Notes</h1>
    <h2>Reading: Remembering User's Info</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Followed <a href="./story_editor.html">the tutorial on using localStorage</a>. It was pretty straight forward. First time using localStorage.getItem(key) and localStorage.setItem(key, value).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Portfolio creation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Learned how to create and append HTML elements to a page using createElement and appendChild. Reference: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4772774/how-do-i-create-a-link-using-javascript">StackOverflow</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/courses/master-mobile-ux-2952">Master Mobile UX</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Mobile-first design means focus on <strong>content</strong> and <strong>core functionalities</strong>. Responsive design does not mean mobile-first.</li>
      <li>A paradigm shift happened with the creation of smartphones.</li>
      <li>Mobile-first is time consuming and costly for a full rebuild but provides the best experience across all devices, addresses constraints of mobile size/bandwidth, and is scalable if things change in the future.</li>
      <li><strong>Start small and scale up.</strong></li>
      <li>Think about <strong>reachability</strong>: most users use their thumbs, making the bottom of the screen the most accessible space to use. Users use a one-handed grip, making the bottom-right part of the screen the most accessible for them.</li>
      <li>Placing the navbar at the bottom of the screen can make a great difference for the users. It can create the illusion of speed and increase user satifaction.</li>
      <li>Forms can be complited to fill for user on mobile. Getting rid of labels and using placeholder and floating labels can be a good way to make things less cramped. Enable auto-completed on forms. Link anchor tags to phone numbers. <strong>Think outside the box!</strong></li>
      <li>Pop-ups/pop-overs are evil! :D Keep ads simple, sleek, and unobtrusive.</li>
    </ul>
